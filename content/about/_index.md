# About me

My full name is Enrique Kessler Mart√≠nez, nice to meet you! I am a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon, where we serve In-App and Push Notifications to Kindle Customers in iOS, Android and FireOS. I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Murcia.

I was born in Murcia, Spain and I have lived in the region my entire life (Cartagena :muscle:), benefiting from the amazing weather and the kind people. I have been in nature a lot since my childhood, being part of a Scout group and by going on hikes are runs anytime I have the chance.

I love learning, both from books and the internet. I work on personal projects to pick up new technologies and keep myself learning every day. On this website, I will publish most of my findings of the amazing world that we live in in the form of book reviews, notes and articles. I believe the openness will help me improve personally and professionally. Buckle up!
