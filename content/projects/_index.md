# Projects

I have been working on personal projcts for a long time, as I believe they are the best way to consolidate the technologies you learn. I'm a bigfan of open-source software. To showcase my projects and colaborate with other engineers (or non-tech people, contributions always welcome!), I use [Github](https://github.com/Qkessler).

From time to time, I also publish some of my results to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrique-kessler-martinez/).
